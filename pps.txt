DCPU-16 Hardware Info:
    Name: Pulsar Positioning System (navigator)
    ID: 0xfce26509
    Version: 0xb01e
    Manufacturer: 0x982d3e46 (TALON NAVIGATION SYSTEMS)

Description:
    PPS can determine it's position using radio-wave and x-ray signals 
    from pulsars. PPS functions flawlesly throughout the Solar System, but 
    requires a dish antenna of 2m in diameter. Talon is the only provider
    of PPS systems that can utilize over 2000 beacon pulsars for 
    measuring position.

    Talon PPS hardware provides the fastest signal acquisition on market.
    It can cold start (no time, no position, no ephemeris) in <55 seconds
    and maintains a steady position update rate of whopping 1 Hz.

Interrupt behavior:
    When a HWI is received by the PPS, it reads the A register and does one
    of the following actions:

    0: RESET_LOCAL_ORIGIN
       Sets current position as the new origin for subsequent 
       GET_LOCAL_COORDINATES -queries.
    
       Register C is set with the operation status:
          0x0000       : Success
          0x8000       : Failure, no pulsar fix
          0x8001       : Failure, cannot reset with reduced accuracy
          0xffff       : Equipment malfunction

    1: GET_LOCAL_COORDINATES
       Stores the current position data to DCPU-16 registers X, Y and Z.
       Halts the DCPU-16 for 6 cycles.

       The data is encoded as
         X (INT16) x-coordinate (unit 1km)
         Y (INT16) y-coordinate (unit 1km)
         Z (INT16) z-coordinate (unit 1km)

       Register C is set with the operation status:
          0x0000       : Success
          0x0001       : Success, but reduced accuracy
          0x8000       : Failure, no pulsar fix
          0x8002       : Failure, out of range
          0xffff       : Failure, equipment malfunction

    2: GET_GLOBAL_COORDINATE_X
    3: GET_GLOBAL_COORDINATE_Y
    4: GET_GLOBAL_COORDINATE_Z

       Stores the current x/y/z-coordinate (unit 1km) to DCPU-16 registers 
         X: bits 47-32
         Y: bits 31-16
         Z: bits 15-0

       Register C is set with the operation status:
          0x0000       : Success
          0x0001       : Success, but reduced accuracy
          0x8000       : Failure, no pulsar fix
          0xffff       : Failure, equipment malfunction
